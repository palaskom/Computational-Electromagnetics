# Computational-Electromagnetics
Implementing the Finite Element Method (FEM) for solving 2-D Electromagnetic problems. Study of:
1)	the electrostatic field in a parallel plate capacitor with finite width and in a coaxial cable
2)	the electromagnetic wave propagation in waveguide with circular cross section and the scattering from infinite circular perfectly conductive cylinder
